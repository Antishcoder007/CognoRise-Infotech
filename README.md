- Offer the option to play again.

#### Usage:
1. Run the Rock, Paper, Scissors game script.
2. Enter your choice (rock, paper, or scissors) when prompted.
3. View the computer's choice and the game result.
4. Optionally, play another round.

### 4. QR Code Encoder/Decoder

A project to generate and decode QR codes.

#### Features:
- Generate QR codes for information like URLs or texts.
- Decode QR codes to retrieve the embedded data.
- Utilize libraries like `qrcode` and `opencv-python` for image processing and data encoding.

#### Usage:
1. Run the QR code encoder/decoder script.
2. Enter the information you want to encode into a QR code.
3. View the generated QR code.
4. To decode, provide the QR code image to the decoder script and retrieve the embedded data.
